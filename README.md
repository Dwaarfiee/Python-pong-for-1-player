# Python-pong-for-1-player
My first solo project

Its a game of pong, where player tries not to drop a ball under the moving platform.
The goal is to score the hieghest points. There is no limit but the catch is, it's get progresivelly harder, because after achiving some milestone some parameters of the game become randomized.
First milestone is changing size and speed of moving platform. Speed is changing every time moving keys are released and size of the platform is changing every time it hits the ball.
Second milestone is changing speed linearity of the ball, every time it hits the platform.
After the ball hits the bottom of the screen, score resets.
